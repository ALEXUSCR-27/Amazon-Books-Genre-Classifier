## About The Project
This project aims to classify books into their main genres based on their titles or descriptions. It uses Machine Learning techniques, particularly a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, to analyze book titles and predict their respective genres. The model was trained on a Amazon books dataset containing book `Titles`, `Authors`, `Main Genre`, `Sub Genre` and more attributes.

## Features
- Dataset: The dataset can be found in the following link: [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chhavidhankhar11/amazon-books-dataset?resource=download). It includes 3 different datasets: **Books_df**, **Genre**, and **Sub_Genre**.  
  For this project we used **Books_df** dataset, which contains the following columns: `Titles`, `Authors`, `Main Genre`, `Subgenre`, `Type`, `Price`, `Rating`, `No. of people voted`, `URLs`. Subsequently, a transformation process was carried out to clean and prepare the data for analysis and model trainning.
- Data Analysis: Several visualizations were performed to gain insights into the dataset:
  - A plot showing the relationship between book ratings and the number of votes each book received per genre.
  - Analysis of average book prices across different genres, revealing pricing trends per genre.
  - Visualization of the top 10 authors with the most expensive books registerd by Amazon, highlighting high-value authors.
  - A scatter plot showing book price distribution by genre, providing an overview of price variability within each genre.
- Preprocessing: Text preprocessing includes lowering case, removing stop words, and using n-grams to capture meaningful patterns in the titles.
- Model: The core classifier is a trained **SVM model** that processes the titles or descriptions and predicts the most likely genre.
- Vectorization: The titles are converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent their text-based features in a way the **SVM model** can process.
- Evaluation: The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics like F1-score and recall.
- Gradio Interface: An interactive interface was built using Gradio to allow users to input a book title and receive predictions about the book's most likely genre based on the trained model.
